			<p>We’ve been told our whole lives that fruits, veggies, and whole grains are healthy.</p>

			<p>But a mountain of evidence now shows that many of these so-called “health foods” actually contain a harmful compound that could be significantly worse than sugar.</p>

			<p>The man behind this stunning discovery is Dr. Steven Gundry — a world-renowned heart surgeon based in Palm Springs, California.</p>

			<p>“This nasty substance can rip tiny tears throughout your entire gut lining,” says Dr. Gundry. “This then allows harmful bacteria and waste products to seep into your bloodstream and wreak havoc on your body.”</p>

			<p>Researchers currently estimate that this widespread issue is causing millions of people to struggle with fatigue, indigestion, weight gain, brain fog, sore joints and muscles, and sometimes even skin problems.</p>

			<p>But thankfully, it’s a problem that can easily be addressed at home.</p>

			<p>“The solution is very simple, you just have to know which foods are actually healthy and which foods contain this hidden compound,” explains Dr. Gundry.</p>

			<p>By simply eliminating this substance, he has seen thousands of his own patients achieve remarkable turnarounds. (In fact, he even lost 70lbs himself and has kept the weight off ever since.)*</p>

			<p>Now, after years of research, Dr. Gundry has decided to release a <a class="nextPage presentation-link" href="https://www.zegea.com/TPXKKH2L/XL2BXRCT?source_id={UTM_SOURCE}&amp;sub1={TAG_ID}&amp;sub2={TRACKING_ID}&amp;campaign_id={CAMPAIGN_ID}&amp;sub3={AD_SET_ID}&amp;sub4={AD_ID}&amp;sub5={LINK_ID}">short video</a> to the public — free and uninterrupted — revealing exactly which foods you and your loved ones should avoid.</p>

			<p>“Our health is our greatest gift,” he explains. “So if this video helps people look better and feel better, I’m thrilled to be of service.”</p>

			<p>The video has since gone viral, first being shared by users on Facebook, then being featured on news sites like ABC and CBS.</p>

			<p>So far, the comments and feedback have been encouraging, with thousands of Americans feeling better than they have in decades.</p>

			<p>Dr. Gundry also serves as the personal physician to many A-list celebrities, including self-help guru Tony Robbins, Academy Award-winning actor Alan Arkin, and Grammy Award-winning singer Usher to name a few.</p>

			<p>But you don't have to be a celebrity to look and feel better using the tips in this video.</p>

			<p>There's just one thing Dr. Gundry asks from his viewers:</p>

			<p>“If watching this helps you take control of your weight, increase your energy, ease gas and bloating, or find relief from stiff joints… then please consider sharing this video with your loved ones at some point. Because together, we can help as many people as possible avoid these frustrating health issues.”</p>
